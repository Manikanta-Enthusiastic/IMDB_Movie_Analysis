(A) **Data Cleaning:** This step involves preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis. It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types if necessary, and possibly feature engineering.

(B) **Five 'Whys' Approach:** This technique will help you dig deeper into the problem. For instance, if you find that movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings, you can ask "Why?" repeatedly to uncover the root cause.

(C) **Data Analysis:** Here, you'll explore the data to understand the relationships between different variables. You might look at the correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc. You might also want to consider the year of release, the actors involved, and other relevant factors.

(D) **Report and Data Story:** After your analysis, you'll create a report that tells a story with your data. This should include your initial problem, your findings, and the insights you've gained. Use visualizations to help tell your story and make your findings more understandable.
